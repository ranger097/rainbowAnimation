#Rainbow Animation

A synthwave-inspired rainbow animation that you can use for text or backgrounds to style a webpage.

If you are unsure how to use this, I left a comment at the top of the script.

Just paste that in the CSS for any element you want styled with the animation.

These are warm colors that you would normally see in a sunset or typically in synthwave-styled themes.

This animation looks really good on links and buttons, but I tend to use it on headers if the theme is darker.

I plan on making another with colder colors that match so that the website can have two sets of rainbow color waves.

That will be ideal if you decide you would like to have the borders styled with the warmer colors and a few buttons with the colder colors.

Just be careful not to go too crazy; the rainbow animation looks great but can easily be overdone.
